# Twitter Clone API with Django and Django REST Framework

## Overview
This repository contains the backend API implementation of a Twitter Clone project built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). The API serves as the core functionality provider for the frontend part of the Twitter Clone, handling user authentication, posting tweets, following users, liking and retweeting tweets, and providing real-time updates.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Implements secure user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Tweet Management:** Provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tweets.
- **User Management:** Handles user registration, login, profile management, and following/unfollowing other users.
- **Like and Retweet Functionality:** Allows users to like and retweet tweets with real-time updates.
- **Timeline Generation:** Generates user-specific timelines with tweets from followed users for a personalized experience.
- **Search Functionality:** Enables users to search for tweets or users by username or content.
- **Pagination:** Implements pagination to efficiently handle large volumes of data.
- **Custom Endpoints:** Includes custom endpoints for specific functionalities such as user profile details and follower/following lists.

## Technologies Used
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework for rapid development.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF):** A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Used for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **WebSocket:** Provides real-time updates for tweet likes, retweets, and new tweets.
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL:** Used as the database backend for storing tweet and user data.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** Generates API documentation for easy reference.
